## Introduction

The Agora Web SDK NG provides methods for you to implement built-in encryption and set encryption password.

> - Both the Communication and Live-broadcast scenarios support channel encryption. For live broadcasts, if you need to use CDN for streaming, recording, and storage, do not use channel encryption.
> - Ensure that both receivers and senders use channel encryption, otherwise, you may meet undefined behaviors such as no voice and black screen.

The following figure shows how Agoraâ€™s communications use built-in encryption:

## Implementation

Before proceeding, ensure that you have implemented the basic real-time communication function in your project. For details, see [Implement a Basic Video Call](basic_call.md).

The `client` object in the following sample code is created by calling `AgoraRTC.createClient`.

```js
// Sets encryption mode to "aes-128-xts","aes-256-xts" or "aes-128-ecb".
// Set the encryption password
client.setEncryptionConfig(encryptionMode, password);
```

### API reference
- [`AgoraRTCClient.setEncryptionConfig`](/api/en/interfaces/iagorartcclient.html#setencryptionconfig)

## Considerations
Call `AgoraRTCClient.setEncryptionConfig` before joining a channel.
